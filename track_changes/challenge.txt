There are 11 billions combinations

Each combination is combined by 3 different numbers a,b, and c. Let's denote 1 combination by (a, b, c)

We process the combinations on 100 computers. There are only X good combinations left after processing. However, these good combinations are stored in 100 different Sqlite database files.

We must learn as following:
given a combination (a, b, c)
[a, b]: c
[a, c]: b
[b, c]: a
In other words, all pairs in a combination know the other belonging to the combination.
Difficulty: we have 100 different database files. Assume we learn separately from each file, we always have to look up in the table where is [a, b] for example, and update its value. <<< This might be solved if we sorted (a, b, c) before processing.
Output:
[a, b]: {c, g, ...} - let denote {c, g, ...} as rel([a, b])
...

------

Now we expand the knowledge of relationships by looking at values of pairs:
[a, b, c]: rel([a, b]) intersects rel([a, c]) int. rel([b, c])

This means we need to look up 3 pairs in the database, then use their values to form a new database for a triplet.
