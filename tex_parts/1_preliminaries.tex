\section{Notation and Basic Terminology}

\paragraph{Vectors and Matrices}

Vectors $\underline{v}$ are denoted by underlined letters. Unless
stated otherwise, vectors are indexed starting from 1, i.e. $v=\left[v_{1},\ldots,v_{n}\right]$.
Vectors are usually considered to be row vectors. Matrices $\boldsymbol{V}$
are shown in bold and capital letters. Elements of matrices or vectors
are surrounded by square brackets, and elements of tuples are surrounded
by round brackets.

\paragraph{Vector space}

A vector space of dimension $n$ over a finite field with $q$ elements
is denoted by $\ensuremath{\mathbb{F}}_{q}^{n}$. 

\paragraph{Gaussian coefficient}

Gaussian coefficient (also known as $q$-binomial) counts the number
of subspaces of dimension $k$ in a vector space $\ensuremath{\mathbb{F}}_{q}^{n}$,

\[
\left[\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k
\end{array}\right]_{q}=\stackrel[i=0]{k-1}{\prod}\frac{q^{n}-q^{i}}{q^{k}-q^{i}}
\]


\paragraph{Multigraph}

A graph is permitted to have multiple edges. Edges that are incident
to same vertices can be in parallel.

\paragraph{Directed Acyclic Graph}

A finite directed graph with no directed cycles, i.e. it consists
of a finite number vertices and edges, with each edge directed from
a vertex to another, such that there is no loop from any vertex $v$
with a sequence of directed edges back to the vertex again $v$.

\paragraph{Multicast}

Multicast communication supports the distribution of a data packet
to a group of users \cite{Zhang:2012}. It can be one-to-many or many-to-many
distribution \cite{Harte:2008}. In this study, we consider only one-to-many
multicast network.

\paragraph{Asymptotic Behavior}

For the combinatorial results, we study the asymtotic behaviour of
some formulas depending on the alphabet size $q$ and the vector length
$t$, by using the Bachmann-Landau notation, i.e. $\mathcal{O}\left(f\left(q,t\right)\right)$
for upper, $\Theta\left(f\left(q,t\right)\right)$ for tight, and
$\Omega\left(f\left(q,t\right)\right)$ for lower bounds, where $f$
is a function of the alphabet size and the vector length.

\section{Definition}

EACH DEFINITION
\begin{defn}[Grassmannian Code]
 A Grassmannian code is a set of all subspaces of dimension $k\leq n$
in $\ensuremath{\mathbb{F}}_{q}^{n}$, and is denoted by $\mathcal{G}_{q}\left(n,k\right)$.
Due to being the set of all subspaces that have the same dimension
$k$, it is also called a \textit{constant dimension code}. \cite{Zhang:2019}
\end{defn}
%
\begin{defn}[Projective Space]
 The \textit{projective space of order} $n$ is a set of all subspaces
of $\ensuremath{\mathbb{F}}_{q}^{n}$, and is denoted by $\mathcal{P}_{q}\left(n\right)$,
i.e. a union of all dimension $k=0,\ldots n$ subspaces in $\ensuremath{\mathbb{F}}_{q}^{n}$
or $\mathcal{P}_{q}\left(n\right)=\bigcup_{k=0}^{n}\mathcal{G}_{q}\left(n,k\right)$.
\cite{Wachter-Zeh:2018}
\end{defn}
%
\begin{defn}[Covering Grassmannian code]
 An $\alpha-\left(n,k,\delta\right)_{q}^{c}$ covering Grassmannian
code (code in short) $\mathcal{C}$ is a subset of $\mathcal{G}_{q}\left(n,k\right)$
such that each subset of $\alpha$ codewords of $\mathcal{C}$ span
a subspace whose dimension is at least $\delta+k$ in $\ensuremath{\mathbb{F}}_{q}^{n}$.
\cite{Zhang:2019}
\end{defn}

\paragraph{The cardinality of a Grassmannian code}

The cardinality of $\mathcal{G}_{q}\left(n,k\right)$ is the Gaussian
coefficient (also known as $q$-binomial), which counts the number
of subspaces of dimension $k$ in a vector space $\ensuremath{\mathbb{F}}_{q}^{n}$,

\[
\left|\mathcal{G}_{q}\left(n,k\right)\right|=\left[\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k
\end{array}\right]_{q}=\stackrel[i=0]{k-1}{\prod}\frac{q^{n}-q^{i}}{q^{k}-q^{i}},
\]

where $q^{\left(n-k\right)k}\leq\left[\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k
\end{array}\right]_{q}\leq4q^{\left(n-k\right)k}$.

\begin{defn}[Subspace packing]
 A subspace packing $t-\left(n,k,\lambda\right)_{q}^{m}$ is a set
$\mathcal{S}$ of $k$-subspaces or $k$-dimensional subspaces (called
\textit{blocks}), such that each $t$-subspace of $\ensuremath{\mathbb{F}}_{q}^{n}$
is contained in at most $\lambda$ codewords of $\mathcal{C}$. \cite{Etzion:2018}
\end{defn}
%
\begin{defn}
$\mathcal{A}_{q}\left(n,k,t;\lambda\right)$ denotes the maximum size
of a $t-\left(n,k,\lambda\right)_{q}^{m}$ code, where there are no
repeated codewords. \cite{Etzion:2018}
\end{defn}
